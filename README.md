Developed a machine learning model for technical exam paper assessment with the pivotal goal of
assessing marks for a given answer, both syntactically and semantically.	

Secondary goal of this project is to eliminate any preference that a paper checker would hold. Moreover,
providing an elegant breakdown analysis of the student’s answer which could possibly reduce paper
checker’s stress.	

Defined an algorithm that could syntactically as well as semantically compare a student’s answer with an
ideal pre-fed answer.	

Implemented machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to achieve the aforementioned task.
